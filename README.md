# Flip-Pins_CAD_Libraries
These are the Flip-Pins CAD libraries for Altium, Kicad, and Eagle. PCB footprints and schematic symbols.

The Altium library was created by Philip Freidin.

The Kicad library was created by Anool of @WyoLum and can also be accessed [on GitHub here](https://github.com/wyolum/flip-pins)

The Eagle library was created by someone that wants to remain anonymous.
This library does not have 3D models. If you have the ability to add 3D
models to this library, given the available step models, please send an
email to philip@oshchip.org
